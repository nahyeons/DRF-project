# 👩🏻‍💻 Project Introduction

Through the Sparta Coding Club Bootcamp, I performed my personal tasks using Django's DRF with the theme of Spartan Market.


A basic second-hand transaction web using django was implemented, and the actual purchased features and regional classification were not implemented.


We didn't implement it on the front end, but we used postman to do tasks around the back end.
